Gameplay: 
	Two teams compete against each other in a game of Jeopardy! Teams are self-directed and can be of any size. 

	Enter your team names on the main menu. Once team names are decided and entered, press play to start the game. 

	There are 5 categories with 5 questions each. The dollar value for each question is the amount you can earn if you answer correctly. 

	Teams can take turns choosing questions or teams can race to answer the question first. It's all up to you!

	After the team(s) have chosen an answer, you can click on the name of the team who won the question to award them their money.

	After completing a question, it will disappear from the board. Once all questions have been completed, the game is over and the team with the most money wins!

	Questions and categories can be edited by changing the included .csv files in src/application/data.
